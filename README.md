# SimpleBox4Planet

This **Excel-based tool** implements the **SimpleBox v4.04** multimedia fate model and includes a curated library of **3,993 PFAS substances** selectable directly within the workbook.

Developed by **NovaMechanics Ltd**, it simulates the environmental **fate, transport, and exposure** of chemicals under steady-state and quasi-dynamic conditions across key compartments:
- **Air (A)**
- **Freshwater (FW)**
- **Marine Water (MW)**
- **Soil (S)**
- **Sediment (SD)**

## 📥 Input Format

The Excel workbook (`SimpleBox4Planet_PFAS.xlsx`) expects the following user inputs on the **Input** sheet:

1. **Substance selection (PFAS):** choose one entry from the built-in list of **3,993 PFAS**.  
2. **Emission scenario:** specify emissions per compartment (e.g., air, freshwater, soil) in appropriate units (e.g., kg·day⁻¹).  
3. **Environmental settings:** provide or confirm scenario parameters (e.g., compartment volumes/areas, intermedia transfer rates, degradation half-lives, partitioning).  
4. **Run/Calculate:** update calculations to generate steady-state / quasi-dynamic **masses, concentrations, and inter-compartment fluxes**.

**Outputs** (on the **Results** sheet) typically include:  
- Predicted **concentrations** and **masses** per compartment  
- **Fluxes** between compartments  
- High-level indicators suitable for screening-level assessments
